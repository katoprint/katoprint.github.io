                    Part of a larger work, Spaced Out offers a glimpse at a singular moment in time: 
                    the death of the astronaut. As his head is cut off a bouquet of flowers springs forth.
                    The flowers and colors each represent an emotion that is felt at the exact moment of
                    his death.
