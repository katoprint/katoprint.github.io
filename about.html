                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caden Sato handles digital prints with archival pigment on a mix of 
                    watercolor and archival papers. Caden makes use of a full bleed technique with digital prints, 
                    breaking the borders of conventional archival prints. Further pushing this theme, 
                    large popouts that resemble those of children's books adds a layer of excitement to an 
                    otherwise 2D space. His work often emulates the style and technique of manga and comic books, 
                    representing narratives through a sequence of panels meant to lead the viewer through small 
                    sections of a larger story. Brutalist/form follows function style architecture are common 
                    settings for these stories. Caden often conflates these two separate themes to create over 
                    the top and quirky narratives that challenge identity and professionalism. Caden is currently 
                    studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He is set to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelors 
                    of Fine Arts. For the past three years he has been studying digital imaging under 
                    Scott Groeniger, building his knowledge for handling professional as well as experimental ink 
                    jet printing. In 2025, Caden received the most outstanding undergraduate student in digital 
                    imaging from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
