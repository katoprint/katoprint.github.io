                <p><span>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work in graphite on paper and digital medium print. My prints make use of watercolor paper, 
                    allowing me to bend and fold them to create 3D forms in an otherwise 2D space. Manga and comics 
                    have been a recent obsession of mine within the past few years. How deeper interpersonal conflicts 
                    are tackled through often quirky and hyper stylised caricatures captivates me. Dynamic action and 
                    fight scenes, and how they can serve as a vessel for conflict resolution grips me the most. 
                    To emphasize this dynamicism, I cut out certain subjects and raise them above the paper giving these 
                    pieces an almost playful children’s popup book feel.     
                </span></p>
                <p><span>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My narratives often explore themes of individuality and identity, of how we 
                    struggle to be our true selves against what society wants us to be. Many characters I create don masks 
                    against their will, emulating my own struggles to break free of parental expectations. As I create my works, 
                    I reflect upon my experiences of explaining my profession, being met with empty replies: “oh cool” and “that’s 
                    interesting”. Writing and drawing these tales serve as outlets for my frustration as an artist, producing in 
                    a world that measures contribution to society in capitalistic wealth.
